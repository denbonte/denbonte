## Hello There 👀

![Hello There!](assets/hello_there.gif)

My name is Dennis. I am a passionate researcher, coder and Linux enthusiast trying to build software to accelerate AI solutions into clinical practice 🤖 🏥

I obtained my BSc degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and my MSc degree (with a focus on Signal Processing) at the University of Brescia, Italy, where I was born and raised 🇮🇹

After my Master Degree, I worked in a multidisciplinary group between Glasgow, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 and my hometown to develop AI pipelines for Brain MRI segmentation. Throughout this wonderful experience I was supervised by my colleague (and friend!) [@rockNroll87q](https://github.com/rockNroll87q).

#### 🌱 What Do I Do

Currently, I am a research scholar at the [Harvard's AIM Program](https://github.com/AIM-Harvard) 🇺🇸 and a Ph.D. Student at Maastricht University 🇳🇱

My research focuses on AI applied to clinical and medical imaging data (such as CT, MRI, and X-Ray), especially in the fields of radiology, radiation oncology and cardiology. During my Ph.D., I developed a profound interest in open source, open science and reproducible research. This interest eventually led me and a few colleagues sharing the open source values to the development of [MHub.ai](https://mhub.ai) - a platform that aims to revolutionize the dissemination of AI models in medical imaging by providing meticulously curated, optimized, and portable AI-based imaging pipelines, empowering researchers with reproducible science and cutting-edge advancements in the field.

In keeping with this theme, I am also part of the [NCI's Imaging Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons) team, where I work on integrating AI-based medical image analysis pipelines into the platform and harnessing the power of the cloud for reproducible research.

On my GitHub you can also find random repositories forked or created typically while trying to learn something off-work.
