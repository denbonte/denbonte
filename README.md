## Hello There 👀

My name is Dennis. I am a passionate coder trying to build software to accelerate AI solutions into clinic practice 🤖 🏥

I obtained my BSc degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and my MSc degree (with a focus on Signal Processing) at the University of Brescia, Italy, where I was born and raised 🇮🇹

After my Master Degree, I worked in a multidisciplinary group between Glasgow, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 and my hometown to develop AI pipelines for Brain MRI segmentation. Throughout this wonderful experience I was supervised by my colleague (and friend!) [@rockNroll87q](https://github.com/rockNroll87q).

#### 🌱 What Do I Do Now?

Currently, I am a research scholar at the [Harvard's AIM Program](https://github.com/AIM-Harvard) 🇺🇸 and a PhD Student at Maastricht University 🇳🇱

I am part of the [NCI's Imaging Data Commons](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons) team, working on integrating AI-based imaging analysis pipelinest in the platform.
